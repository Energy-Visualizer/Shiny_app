     <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>Writers will now be able to only revise the structure of both text and outline. This will be done by AI being able to detect what part of the outline a specific section of writing should go. We are going to build on an existing AI model called spaCy to help us to be able to look at parts of text in order to determine the right place for it in the writing.  The section of that text which has to be moved is highlighted and moved to the correct position of the text editor using vectors after receiving the command from the user.</p>
